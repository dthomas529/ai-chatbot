Project Title: AI ChatBot for online store
Task: Build generative AI chatbot
Criteria: 
Access OpenAI API for chatbot model
Write code
Summary: 
I used Python and Jupyter Notebook te write the code because this is the backend language that I’m studying.  Then, I created an OpenAI account and accessed API keys for the chatbot.
Functionality: When the user enters the name of a product, the chatbot displays its name and price. Then, the chatbot completes the order by totaling the order and gets delivery or pick information.
Design: The layout is user friendly
